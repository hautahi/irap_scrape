The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of symptoms such as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, and dizziness and nausea.[2]  These symptoms appear to be linked to time spent in a building, though no specific illness or cause can be identified.  SBS is also used interchangeably with ""building-related symptoms"", which orients the name of the condition around patients rather than a ""sick"" building.  A 1984 World Health Organization (WHO) report suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be subject of complaints related to poor indoor air quality.[3]
